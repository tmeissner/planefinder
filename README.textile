p(. A small device which is used to find model planes which landed somewhere in the field. The device works as follows:

# Device is switched on
# Short buzzer tone for function test
# 20 minutes nothing happens ;)
# Short buzzer tones, alternating by the two buzzers
# You find the plane and switch off the device ;)
